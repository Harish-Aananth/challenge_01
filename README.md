###Generic Font Families

    In CSS there are five generic font families:

    Serif 			fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
    Sans-serif 		fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
    Monospace 		fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
    Cursive 		fonts imitate human handwriting.
    Fantasy 		fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
